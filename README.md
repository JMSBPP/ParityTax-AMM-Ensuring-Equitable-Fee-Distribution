## Overview
A data-driven AMM protocol that aims to minimize fee revenue concentration by JIT liquidity providers with a progressive tax based on the time an LP leaves their asset inventories in the pool, incorporated into the trading fees. This is designed to reward liquidity depth provided by ex-ante liquidity providers.
