# Solidity Documentation Rules

## Overview
You are creating NatSpec documentation for Solidity smart contracts following industry best practices and official guidelines.

## Reference Resources
- [RareSkills Solidity Style Guide](https://rareskills.io/post/solidity-style-guide)
- [Official Solidity NatSpec Format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/natspec-format.html)
- [NatSpec Comments Best Practices](https://medium.com/coinmonks/natspec-comments-in-solidity-the-key-to-writing-readable-and-maintainable-code-7022e51a12e7)
- [Official Solidity Style Guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html)

## Documentation Requirements

### TODO Comments
- All code commented with `TODO:` must be placed in a markdown file with the grammatically corrected version
- Include reference to which part of the code it refers to
- For documentation, include the TODO part as a warning in `@dev` or `@notice` tags as appropriate

### NOTE Comments
- Comments marked as `//NOTE` need to be included with the grammatically corrected version
- Place these in `@dev` or `@notice` tags as most convenient

## Workflow for Multiple Contracts
When documenting multiple contracts:
1. Process one contract at a time
2. Complete documentation for the current contract
3. Ask the user for permission to proceed to the next contract
4. If user approves: move to the next contract and repeat
5. If user rejects: apply the corrections outlined in their feedback before proceeding

## Quality Standards
- The documentation goes on the solidity file following the above natspec stantdsrds not in any other file 
- Ensure all documentation follows proper grammar and spelling
- Maintain consistency across all contract documentation
- Include comprehensive NatSpec tags where appropriate
- Reference specific code locations for clarity
