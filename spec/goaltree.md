# Goal Tree

## Optimize Liquidity Provision System in UniswapV4

**Description:** Maximize liquidity fulfillment through a dynamic JIT/PLP equilibrium, enforced via hook-based taxation and redistribution while managing time-bound LP positions.

### Sub-Goals

*   **Balance JIT and PLP Participation:** Create equilibrium where JITs complement PLPs without crowding them out, using deadline-aware position management.
    *   **Implement JIT Taxation System:** Tax JIT-provided liquidity fees during swaps (via beforeSwap/afterSwap hooks) based on position duration and impact.
        *   **Calculate Context-Aware Tax Rates:** Dynamic tax rates based on JIT position longevity, trade size, and market impact.
        *   **Enforce Deadline Compliance:** Ensure JIT liquidity expires after LP-specified deadlines via hook logic.
    *   **Redistribute to PLPs:** Distribute taxed JIT revenue to PLPs post-liquidity removal (via afterRemoveLiquidity hook).
        *   **Weight PLP Rewards by Contribution:** Allocate rewards based on PLP liquidity depth and longevity.
*   **Maximize System Welfare:** Optimize overall efficiency by calibrating JIT/PLP incentives in real-time.
    *   **Dynamic Parameter Adjustment:** Adjust tax/redistribution parameters via hooks using on-chain data (e.g., JIT/PLP participation ratios).
*   **Ensure Liquidity Fulfillment:** Maintain capacity to fulfill demand through coordinated JIT/PLP participation.
    *   **Facilitate JIT Liquidity Windows:** Enable short-term JIT provisioning for large trades without disrupting PLP depth.
    *   **Sustain PLP Baseline Depth:** Ensure PLPs are rewarded sufficiently to maintain always-on liquidity.
