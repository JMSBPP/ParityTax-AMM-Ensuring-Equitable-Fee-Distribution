# IParityTaxHook

This interface defines the external functions of the `ParityTaxHook` contract. It inherits from `IImmutableState`, which provides access to the `poolManager` address. As the hook's external functions are primarily the standard Uniswap V4 hook callbacks, this interface is currently minimal.
